# Aura Health: An Analysis of User Activity & Engagement
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization dashboard built using Google Looker Studio. The goal was to analyze user activity and engagement data from a 30-day period for a health and wellness app, Aura Health.

The analysis reveals a significant opportunity for growth by identifying key user segments and uncovering a major trend in user activity. The insights are presented through a 5-page interactive dashboard.

Key Findings & Insights
User Segmentation: The user base is almost perfectly divided between two distinct segments: a "Very Active" group and a large "Sedentary" group. This clear division allows for tailored and effective marketing and retention strategies.

The "Sunday Slump": Analysis revealed a significant drop in average user activity on Sundays, presenting a key opportunity for a targeted engagement campaign to boost weekend activity.

Data Validation: A strong positive correlation (0.59) was found between steps and calories burned, confirming the reliability and consistency of the data collected by the wellness device.

Actionable Recommendations: The report concludes with three key business recommendations, including a pilot retention program for sedentary users and a gamified campaign to address the "Sunday Slump."

Dashboard Pages
The dashboard is structured to tell a clear, data-driven story:
