## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **data analysis and visualization dashboard** built using **Google Looker Studio**.

## 🔑 Key Findings & Insights
- **User Segmentation:**  
  The user base is almost evenly split between two distinct groups:  
  - **Very Active Users**  
  - **Sedentary Users**  
  → This clear segmentation enables more **tailored marketing and retention strategies**.  

- **The "Sunday Slump":**  
  A noticeable **drop in average user activity on Sundays** was identified.  
  → This trend highlights an opportunity for a **targeted engagement campaign** to improve weekend activity.  

- **Data Validation:**  
  A **strong positive correlation (0.59)** between steps and calories burned confirms the **reliability and consistency** of the wellness device data.  

- **Actionable Recommendations:**  
  - Launch a **pilot retention program** for sedentary users.  
  - Run a **gamified weekend challenge** to counter the "Sunday Slump".  
  - Personalize marketing campaigns based on **activity segmentation**.
